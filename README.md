## Introduction
AMDTL is an advanced machine learning framework designed to improve the adaptability and robustness of AI models in various domains. By combining meta-learning, adversarial domain adaptation, dynamic feature adjustment, and domain embeddings, AMDTL addresses key challenges in transfer learning and domain adaptation.

## Features
- **Meta-Learning**: Optimal parameter initialization for rapid adaptation to new tasks.
- **Adversarial Domain Adaptation**: Aligns source and target data distributions to reduce negative transfer.
- **Dynamic Feature Adjustment**: Real-time model parameter adjustments based on domain embeddings.
- **Domain Embeddings**: Contextual representations to improve domain-specific adaptations.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/amdtl.git
cd amdtl
